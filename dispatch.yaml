# App Engine Dispatch Rules
# Routes requests to different services based on hostname

dispatch:
  # Route api-dev.x-trillion.ai to maia-dev service
  - url: "api-dev.x-trillion.ai/*"
    service: maia-dev
    
  # Route api.x-trillion.ai to production (default service)
  - url: "api.x-trillion.ai/*"
    service: default
    
  # Don't add a catch-all rule - let App Engine handle service-specific URLs naturally
