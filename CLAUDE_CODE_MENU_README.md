# 🎯 Claude Code Deployment Menu System

## How Your Branching Strategy Works

**Perfect! You understand it exactly right:**

1. **main (Branch 1)** ← PRODUCTION LOCKED for external users
2. **hotfix/* (Branch 2)** ← Critical bug fixes only  
3. **develop (Branch 3)** ← Safe development & consolidation

## The Workflow

```
develop (Branch 3)     → Safe consolidation work, no risk
    ↓ (when ready)
main (Branch 1)        → Production deployment, external users affected
    ↓ (if critical bug)
hotfix/* (Branch 2)    → Emergency fixes → back to main → back to develop
```

## How to Use Claude Code Menu

### Method 1: Launch Menu from Anywhere
```bash
# From any directory:
/Users/andyseaman/Notebooks/json_receiver_project/google_analysis10/launch_claude_menu.sh
```

### Method 2: Launch from Project Directory
```bash
cd /Users/andyseaman/Notebooks/json_receiver_project/google_analysis10
python3 claude_code_menu.py
```

### Method 3: Use with Claude Code Agent
```bash
# In Claude Code:
claude --add-dir /Users/andyseaman/Notebooks/json_receiver_project/google_analysis10
"Run the deployment menu to manage deployments safely"
```
