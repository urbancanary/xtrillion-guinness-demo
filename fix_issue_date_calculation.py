CRITICAL FIX: Issue Date Calculation Error
=========================================

This script fixes the massive duration calculation error caused by 
artificially setting issue dates to 6 months before settlement.

PROBLEM:
--------
Line 155 in google_analysis10.py:
issue_date = calendar.advance(settlement_date, ql.Period(-6, ql.Months))

This makes QuantLib think a 30-year Treasury bond was issued 6 months ago,
causing duration calculations to be off by 6+ years.

SOLUTION:
---------
Replace calculated issue dates with conservative estimates that don't
interfere with duration calculations.
